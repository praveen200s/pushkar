                The <b>Pushkar Fair</b>, also called the Pushkar Camel Fair or
                locally as Kartik Mela or Pushkar ka Mela is an annual multi-day
                livestock fair and cultural fÃªte held in the town of Pushkar
                (Rajasthan, India).
              </p>
              <p>
                In 1998, over 1 million visitors came to Pushkar throughout the
                year.The Pushkar fair alone attracts over 200,000 visitors.

                We visited the Pushkar fair in 2019, with a purpose of
                unearthing the depth & breadth of colors, seen all around the
                festive ground. We documented the market, the lanes, the vendors
                & ofcourse the camel fair.
              </p>
              <p>
                We wanted to undestand the local trend in colors.How different
                or similar is it to global trends ? Do they influence eachother
                or does the local choices stay intact over the years.
              </p>

            <div class="step p-3">
              <p>
                We put 2019 Pushkar Fair as our first anchor for the study. We
                curated almost more than 2000 photographs and selected 500
                images for the analysis.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="step p-3">
              <p>
                We used a mix of tools, custom & few already available to us and
                extracted color pallete from each of the images.We narrowed down
                5 colors for the pallete.Like the first color shown here.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="step p-3">
              <p>then, 2nd color...</p>

              <p>...3rd...</p>

            <div class="step p-3">
              <p>...4th and...</p>
            </div>
            <div class="step p-3">
              <p>final 5th.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="step p-3">
              <p>
                We created a datasheet for each image along with its 5 colors
                palette.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="step p-3">
              <p>At the end, we had 2500 colors.</p>
              <p>
                To move ahead, we simply aligned them along 2 axes and observed
                the bands/groups/clusters of colors. There was not scale to axis
                as colors are inherently intuitive data.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="step p-3">
              <p>First, we mapped HUE values vs Saturation levels.</p>
              <p>Clearly there was a marked clusters of the Red-Violet hues</p>
            </div>
            <div class="step p-3">
              <p>Second, we plotted Saturation levels vs Brightness.</p>
              <p>
                Colors lined up with intervals of brigtness values with each
                separated by ~10-11 points.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="step p-3">
              <p>Third, we plotted Hue values vs Brightness.</p>
              <p>
                Although there was clear intervals of brightness points, the low
                saturated colors were dispersed over a continuous section in
                comparison to high saturated colors.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="step p-3">
              <p>
                The HSB plots did gave little hints to us about the color
                clusters. But we wanted to see the richness in our pallete also.
              </p>
              <p>
                So we placed all the colors togther & made clusters as per each
                color index of the pallete.The potpurri of colors was a delight.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="step p-3">
              <p>
                Further to ascertain the frequancy of colors in our palletes, we
                seggragated the colors on a hue scale with 8 specific hue
                points.
              </p>
              <p>
                The sparse & thick colors showed up naturally in a lovely form.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="step p-3">
              <p>
                This was the part-I of our analysis. The rest will be released
                soon.
